Projet Annotations - OOP

Limitations : we calculate the whole genome matrix for the GAF file we have at the first run
To change it after, you have to delete the file 'whole_annotation_genome.dump' and run the program with another GAF file

Todo : maybe use scipy.sparse because our matrix is veryyyy sparse
We have a lot of loops, maybe we could optimize them (and/or the structure)
